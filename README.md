# Jonatas Leal

Hi thereðŸ‘‹  I am a technology enthusiast software engineer, always seeking to develop efficient and effective solutions that bring value to the business. 

Also, I have a strong foundation in electronics engineering. I've worked as an electronic technician, developing electronic circuit boards of GNSS receivers for Brazilian Army Forces and civil end users.

## Projects

Here are a few projects I've worked on:

- **Project 1**: A C# application that runs on the desktop. It was designed to read in serial data in ASCII format from a device, and then generate a graph of the data in real-time. The user can customize the appearance of the graph, including the X and Y axes, gridlines, and data series. The generated graph can be saved to an image file for later reference or analysis.
The project was implemented using the C# language and the Windows Forms library for the user interface. It also uses a third-party library for generating the graph.  To use the project, the user will need to have a device that outputs serial data in ASCII format and a computer with the .NET framework installed. The project      provides detailed instructions for setting up and using the application.
